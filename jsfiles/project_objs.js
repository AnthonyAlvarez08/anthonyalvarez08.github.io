    Once can conceptualize this class as a kind of game development capstone class and this project is the largest software engineering endeavour which I have undertaken.
    <br> In the game you play as a little mouse that uses a yoyo to fight through an army of frogs in a dungeon.
    <br> I was in charge of the player controller, the map system, and the pause menus.
    <br> Collaborated with: Evan Bertis-Sample, Tae In Shim, and Matthew Khoriaty`,
