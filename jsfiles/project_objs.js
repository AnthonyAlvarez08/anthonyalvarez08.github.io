    <br> In the game you play as a little mouse that uses a yoyo to fight through an army of frogs in a dungeon.
    <br> I was in charge of the player controller, the map system, and the pause menus.
    <br> Collaborated with: Evan Bertis-Sample, Tae In Shim, and Matthew Khoriaty.`,

    `<p>Northwestern University's Robotics Club regularly competes in NHRL, the US's biggest combat robotics competition for the 30lb weight class. </p>
    <p>After helping the club qualify for the 2023 NHRL world championships, the Combat Robotics leads tasked me with making a mini-bot for our 30lb robot Deathpact.
    I engineered and built a 5lb mini-bot that was essentialy a two wheeled, armored RC car with three spikes in the front.</p>


    <p>This was my first real engineering project that I've completed outside of school work. I learned a lot about project management: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> keeping the project within budget.                 </li>
        <li> creating and excuting manufacturing plans.         </li>
        <li> creating and following my own project timeline (only deadline was showing up to NHRL).    </li>
        <li> presenting my design to the club.                  </li>
    </ul>
 
    <p>
    <!--Should I even keep this?--->
    Sad note:
    Changes to NHRL regulations about multi-bots mean that mini-bots are not meta anymore and it is unlikely that Tulin will get to participate more fights.</p>`,

    <span>NURC wants to make an automated lacrosse goalie that can stop any shot from a lacrosse player and I will be leading the computer vision side of things.</span>
    <br><span>Currently the goalie consists of a frame that can move a stopper on a 2D axis in front of the goal and it is controlled by a PS4 controller.</span>
    <br><span>Our goal is to make it fully autonomous by the end of this school year.</span>
    <br><br>
    <p>Goals for this project:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Main Goal: The robot should be able to stop any shot from outside a 12 meter radius</li>
        <li>Extra Goal: The robot should be able to stop any shot from outside an 8 meter radius</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Evaluation plan: Gather Northwestern's women's lacrosse team to take shots at the goalie.</p>

    <p>Estimated completion time: May 2025</p>
